and resources (i.e. desktop computers, laptops, servers, etc.) must be discarded according 
to legal requirements and environmental regulations through the appropriat e extern al 
agents and C IFCL upgrade gui delines. Therefore , all disposal p rocedures for retired IT 
assets must adhere to company -approved methods.  
 
2. Scope  
This policy applies to the proper disposal of all CIFCL IT hardware, including PCs, laptops, 
tabs, prin ters, se rvers, switches , and routers. C ompany -owned surpl us hardware, obs olete 
machines, and any equipment beyond reasonable repair or reuse are covered by this 
policy. Where assets have not reached end of life, it is desirable to achieve some residual 
value of th e IT asset in q uestion through donation, or reass ignment to a les s-critical 
function.  
 
3. Definitions  
• “CIFCL IT hardware” refers to any and all IT assets that are the sole property of 
CIFCL that is, equipment that is not rented, leased, or borrowed fr om a thi rd-party 
suppli er or partner co mpany.  
• “Disposal” refers to the re selling,  donating, or disposing out of IT equipment 
through responsible, ethical, and environmentally sound means.  
• “Obsolete” refers to any and all equipment which no  longer meets r equisite 
functionality.  
• “Surplus” refers  to hardware that has been replace d by upgraded equipment or is 
superfluous to existing requirements.  
• “Beyond reasonable repair” refers to any and all equipment whose condition 
requires fixing that wi ll likely cost eq ual to or more th an total replacement.  
 
 
 
4. Responsibility  
Disposal and dis posal procedures of all IT assets and equipment will be centrally managed 
and coordinated by IT department.   
The responsibility includes responsible f or: 
 
• Backing up  critical data if  any Cholamandalam Investme nt & Finance 
Com pany Limited  Policy Document  Asset  Disposal  Policy  
     
Private and Confidential  Page 5 of 6  • Wipe clean c ompany data on all IT assets slated for disposal  
• Removal  of company tags and/or identifying labels.  
• Select and approve external agents for disposing assets.  
• The IT department is also responsible for acquiri ng credible doc umentation from 
third parties that  are contracted to con duct the disposal process.  
5. Practi ces 
Acceptable methods for the disposal of IT assets are as follows:  
 
• Auctioned.  
• Sold/Disposed  as scrap to a n authorized E -Waste licensed de aler.  
• Reassigned to a less -critical busin ess operation function.  
• Donated to sch ools, charities, and other non -profit organizations.  
• Recycled to leverage further use (within limits of reasonable repair).  
 
6. Policy  
It is the responsibility of all  employee of CIFCL IT department with the appropriate  authority 
to ensure that IT assets, eq uipment, and hardware are disposed  of according to one or 
more of the methods prescribe d above. It is imperative that any disposals perf ormed by 
CIFCL are done appropriately, responsibly, and ethically, as well as wit h company resource 
planning in mind.  All asset disposals should be handl ed only by the E -waste certified 
company.  
 
The follow ing rules must therefore be observed:  
 
Obsolete I T Assets:  As prescribed above, “obsolete” refers to any and all computer or 
compu ter-related equipment that no longer me ets requisite functionality. Ident ifying and 
classifying IT assets as obsolete is the s ole province of  CIFCL IT department.  Equipment 
lifecycles are to be determined by IT asset management best practices (i.e. total cost of 
owne rship, required upgrades, e tc.) 
 
Reassignment of Retired Asse ts: Reassignment of computer hardware to a less -critical 
role is mad e at the sole discretion of CIFCL IT department. It is, however, the goal of CFCL 
to – whenever possible – reassign  IT assets in order to achieve full ret urn on investment 
(ROI) from the e quipment and to minimize hardware expenditures when f easible 
reassig nment to another business function  will do instead.  
 
Trade -Ins: Where applicable, cases in which a piece of equipm ent is due for replacement 
by a newer m odel, reasonable actions must be t aken to ensure that a fair and market trade -Cholamandalam Investme nt & Finance

Refer Information Security Controls Policy v3. 4 
5.0 Threats to Security  
5.1 Amateur Hackers and Vandals  
These people are the most common type of attackers on the Internet.  The probabili ty of attack is 
extremely high and th ere is also likely to be a large number of attacks. These are usuall y crimes of 
opportunity.  Th ese amateur hackers scan the Internet and look for well -known security holes that 
have not been plugged.  Web servers and e lectronic mail are their favourite  targets.  Once they find a 
weakness they will exploit it to plant viru ses, Trojan horses, or use the resources of your system for 
their own means.  If they do not find an obvious weakness they are likely to move on to an easier 
target  
5.2 Personnel  
One of the bi ggest security threats coul d be Personnel. They may damage the syste ms either through 
incompetence or on purpose. CIFCL  to impose security layer to compensate personal threat. CIFCL  
will mitigate this by doing the follo wing  
▪ Provide appropriate system right s on need to know basis  
▪ Advice personnel not to share login informat ion with co -workers to access systems  
▪ Instant removal of access rights when an employee is separated/suspended/pending enquiry  
▪ When employees are separ ated  or disciplined, remove their acc ess to systems timely  
▪ Keep detailed system logs on all computer acti vity 
 
5.3 Criminal Hackers and Saboteurs  
The probability of this type of attack is minimal, but not entirely unlikely given the amount of sensitive 
informa tion contained in databases.  The ski ll of these attackers is me dium to high as they are likely to 
be tra ined in the use of the latest hacker tools. The attacks are well planned and are based on any 
weaknesses discovered that will allow a foothold into the  network.  Cholamandalam Inve stm ent & Finance

electronic files and messages to the extent necessary to ensure that the Inte rnet and other electronic 
communications are being used in compliance with the law and with company policy . 
8.0 Access Control  
A fundamental component of our Cyber Security Policy is con trolling access to the crit ical information 
resources that require protect ion from unauthorized disclosure or modification. The fundamental 
meaning of access control is that permissions are assigned to individuals or syst ems that are 
authorized to access s pecific resources.  Access controls exist at various layers of the system,  including 
the network.  Access control is implemented by logon ID and password.  At the application and 
database level, other access control metho ds c an be implemented to further re strict access.  The 
applica tion and database systems can limit the number of applications and databases available to 
users based on their job requirements.  
8.1 User System and Network Access – Normal User Identification  
All u sers will be required to have a uni que logon ID and password f or access to systems.  Use generic 
and shared ac counts shall be prohibited and in case of exceptions, an approval from CIO/CISO  shall 
be taken.   The user’s password should be kept confidential an d MU ST NOT be shared with 
manageme nt & supervisory personnel and/or any other employee whatsoever. All users  must comply 
with the following rules regarding the creation and maintenance of passwords  as specified in 
Information Security policy.  
Supervisors /  Man agers shall immediately and di rectly contact the company IT Manager to report 
change in employee status that requires terminating or modifying employee logon access privileges.

System Administrators, network ad ministrators, and security administrators will have access to host 
systems , routers, hubs, and firewalls as required to fulfil  the duties of their job.  
All system administrator passwords will be DELETED  immediately after a ny e mployee who has 
access to such  passwords is terminated, f ired, or otherwise leaves the employment of the  company.  
8.3 Special Access  
Special access accounts are provided to individuals/vendors requiring temporary system 
administrator privileges in order to  perform their job / vendor provid ed application troubleshoot ing.  
These accounts are monitored by the compa ny and require the permission of CIFCL’s  CIO and CISO . 
IT shall generate reports that will show who currently has a special access account, for what  reason, 
and when it will expire  and CIO shall review them o n quarterly  basis .  Special accounts will expir e 
based on the requirement from Project manager and will not be automatically renewed without 
written permission  from CIO. 
8.4  Third -Party  connectivity to C IFCL  Network  and Remote Acces s 
This policy is establishe d to ensure a secure method of connectivity pro vided between the company 
and all third -part y companies and other entities required to electronically exchange information with 
company.  
“Third -party ” refers to vendors, consultants and business partners doing  business with company, and 
other partners that  have a need to exchange information with the company.  Third -party network 
connections are to be used only by the employees of the third -party, only  for the business purposes of 
the com pany.  The third -party company will ensure that only authorized users will be allowed to 
access information on the company network.  The third -party will not allow Internet traffic or other 
private network traffic to fl ow i nto the network.  A third -party network connection is de fined as a 
network connection that will termina te on specified time required for troubleshooting  and the third -
party access will be subject to standard company authentication rules.  
This policy ap plies to all third -party connecti on requests and any existin g third -party connections.  In 
cases where the existing third -party network connections do not meet the requirements outlined in 
this document, they will be re -designed as needed.  
Only authorized pers ons may remotely access the c ompa ny network. Remote acce ss is provided to 
those employees, contractors and business partners of the company that have a legitimate business 
need to exchange information, copy files or programs, or access computer applica tions.  Authorized 
connection can  be remote PC to the networ k or a remote network to company network connec tion.  
The only acceptable method of remotely connecting into the internal network is using a VPN secure 
ID. 
8.5  Connecting Devices to the Network  
Only auth orized devices will be connec ted to the company network( s).  Authorized devices include PCs 
and worksta tions owned by company that comply with the configuration guidelines of the company.  
Other authorized devices include network infrastructure devices  used for network management and 
monitoring.  
Users shall not  attach to the network: non -company computers t hat are not authorized, owned and/or 
controlled by company.  Users are specifically prohibited from attaching external network to company 
network.  Cholamandalam Inve stm ent & Finance

the Net work or any unauthorized storage devices, e.g. thumb drives and writable CD’s.  
8.6 Unauthorized Remote Access  
The attachment of Network devices to a user ’s PC or workstation that is conn ected to the company 
LAN is  not allowed without the written permission of the company. Additionally, users may not install 
personal software designed to provide remote control of the PC or workstation. This type of remote 
acces s bypasses the authorized hig hly secure methods of remot e access and poses a threat to the 
security of the entire network.

Data continuity is divided into regular backup and restoratio n programs for any 
disaster recovery and fault -tolerant systems for high availability. Copying of 
data or  information can be achieved using various techniques  to provide the 
ability to restore a critical application  
 
1.1. Backup  
 
• Scheme – Electronic data will b e copied from Disk to Tape for 
servers which are on SAN and for all other Small er files / File 
system  / Folders will be backed up to Disk  and then to a Second  
tape.  The tapes may be created separately or simultaneously. One 
tape shall be kept onsite at the  live Datacenter  and will reside 
inside the tape library . The second tape shall go to an offsit e 
storage location.  
 
• Frequency – Service related electronic dat a will be copied once a 
day using one of the standard backup types (FULL, Incremental or 
Different ial) with a full backup scheduled on Sunday of the week. 
Full backups are required immediately prior to m ajor changes and  
/ or upgrades to services  
 
• Retention  – Daily backup tapes are recycled on a weekly basis, 
Weekly tapes are recycled every month, Month ly backup tapes are 
retained for 12 months and yearly tapes for 8 years  
 
• Off-Site Storage – All backup ta pes designated as Offsite will be 
sent to the offsite  location.  
 
• Scheduling – Execution of backups are carried out during non peak 
hours and with least  activity on the Systems/Service.  
 
• Security – The backup data will be encrypted and copied to t he 
Onsite media, and then the media is labeled and stored in a secure 
place. Backup administrator will have an access to the data only for 
restoration purpose. O ffsite media will be under the custody of 
authorized person at respective locations and will be  provided to 
Backup Administrator incase of any disaster with n ecessary approvals 
from IT Head of the organization.  
 
• All critical data where restoration is more effective than 
recreation should only be backed up.  
  
CIFCL Enterprize Backup Strategy & Media Management                                                             Page 6 of 16 1.2.  Recovery  
 
• Recovery of any application nee ds to brin g back the data stored 
by the users on the applicatio n. The recovery of data is done 
based on the Recovery Time Objective and Recovery poi nt 
objective of the application.  
 
• Recovery procedures as per the available data recovery 
documentation will be carried  out in the event of a disaster.  
 
• Recovery of System/ Service related data can only be requested by 
the representative for the System/Service that they represent  
 
• Recovery of any System/Service related data must be authorized 
by an Information Sec urity Offi cer or the person in -charge.  
 
• Critical data should on ly be backed up if restoration is more 
efficient than re -creation in the event of failure.  
 
• RPO o f this document is to provide data as on the previous 
business day  
2. Definitions  
 
Service Disrupt ions – Occurs when a critical system(s) or service(s) is unavai lable 
during the hours of its advertised availability. Currently there are three (3) categories 
of disruptions:  
 
Incident  - Event that involves or threatens a subset of our production services where 
operations will be able to continue within the same locat ion. 
 
Disaster  - Event that involves or threatens the loss of all operations and/or services 
located either at the onsite / offsite (but not both).  
 
Catastrophe  - Event where all the services i n both Ons ite and Offsite are lost requiring 
services and/or op erations to be moved to the remote site.  
 
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) : The point in time to whi ch systems and data must 
be recovered after an outage (e.g end of previous days’ processing). R POs are of ten 
used as the basis for the development of backup s trategies, and as a determinant of 
the amount of data that may need to be recreated after the syst ems or functions have 
been recovered.  
 
 
 
  
CIFCL Enterprize Backup Strategy & Media Management                                                             Page 7 of 16 Backup Types : Copying data or information can be achi eved using  various techniques 
to provide the ability to restore  a critical service.  
 
Full - A copy of all data associated with a given file, volume (disk), datab ase or 
Computing platform.  
 
Incremental  - A copy of all data changed since the last full backup  or 
increm ental was completed. To restore, the full backup is c reated and then 
each incremental backup is applied in the order each incremental backup was 
create d. 
 
Differential  - A copy of data changed since the last full backup was completed 
but only ret aining the  data reflecting the latest change. To restore, the f ull 
backup is created and the most recent differential backup is applied.  
 
Levels of Data Protecti on:  
 
Transaction Protection – Data that is duplicated at the transaction level to a 
separate f acility. T his protection may be provided by special hardware or  
software.  
 
Incident Protection  – Data on a full backup that is located locally at Onsite.

The company wil l have a cur rent BCP framework i n place to ensure conti nuity of operations in 
the eve nt of a disaster.  
 
7.5. Virus and Other Malware Protection Policy  
7.5.1.  The Ris k 
Malware is the term used to des cribe any software which has been develop ed with the pu rpose 
of infilt rating, comp romising or damaging  a computer system. Vir uses, Worms and Trojans are 
all forms of Malware. Malware can enter a network in various ways via the web, email or data 
brought in to the network on various media.  
Viruses and their pote ntial impact ar e well known  to most of us by no w. It is worth noting t hat 
viruses are deemed to be t he single biggest threat the information systems of any organization  
will face and so it is appropria te that adequate resources are made avail able to counte r this 
threat o n multiple l evels.  
 
7.5.2.  Mitigation  
Besides filters for emai l and web content , there will be systems ( Antivirus  software) in place 
which provide protection ag ainst viruses and malware from ot her sources as well. All the users 
connec ting to the ne twork will have  this instal led on their PC/lapt op. If users from exter nal 
sources like partners and vendors need to operate from the network then they must adhere to 
this policy .  
 
8. Network security  
The contents of this section are aimed at I T services and  are not direct ly relevant to the majority of t he 
computer users . 
 
8.1. Network Security levels  
8.1.1.  Perimeter  Network Security  
Company’s perimeter network that is exposed to pub lic cloud like internet should be  protected 
thru a state -full firewall and  access inform ation by extern al sources i nto the network shou ld be 
logged. Informati on transmitted out of perimete r should be encrypted and necessary protection 
should be in place so  as to avoid the risk of sniffing  over the wire. As organization grows it is 
essential t o ensure that a  necessary t echnology is impleme nted at perimeter level  which does 
intelligent and au tomated intrusion prevention.  
 
8.1.2.  Inter -site communication  
Where traffi c between sites is not physically  or logically isolated or separated from all other 
traffic on the shar ed links the n such traffic must be kept secure and conf idential by using an 
acceptabl e level of encryption. Presently the key branches are connected Via MPLS cloud and 
the CIFCL  branch n etwork is isolated from other external ne tworks in the cloud thru virt ual 
tunnels configured at provid er end. Other Small bra nches are connected thru broad band 
internet. However it is essential to put up a secured connectiv ity for these small branches also  
(Viz hardware or software based solution  that will pro vide encryption  and secure the traffic.  Cholamandalam Investment  & Fin ance 
Company Limited  Policy Docu ment  
Internal  Information S ecurity Po licy 
     
 Page 15 of 31  8.1.3.  Wirel ess security  
All wirele ss connections must be encrypt ed and authenticated.  There should be encryption for 
connections bet ween the wireless network and con nected hosts. The traffic between the wir eless 
network and company wir ed network s hould be firewalled and screened for malici ous content.  
 
8.1.4.  Firewalls  
Firew alls will be under the control of the IT services and the IT service s firewall Administrator. 
There s hould be more than one firewall administr ator and all f irewall configu rations shou ld be 
documented and  kept up to date. All c hanges to the firewall rule ba ses should be subject to the 
successful approval of a written reques t and completion of a change cont rol procedure. The 
change control and app roval procedur e will not be b ypassed beca use a change request  is 
considered urgent. Any change control requests ne ed to be submitted in good time so that 
proper consideration may be given to any requests and their l ikely impact on network security if 
appro ved.  
 
8.1.5.  Access t o Network Compo nents  
All ne twork components use d at the core and enter prise network must be authenti cated against 
a ISE server and changes done on the network component s must be logged for audit purpos e. 
Any Changes made to network components  at critical l evels will go t hru change c ontrol process.  
 
8.1.6.  Encryption and Digital Si gnatures  
Encryption must be us ed to provide maximum protection to classified, sensitive and 
confid ential information. The need and the extent of utilization of encryption m ethods should 
be justified by  clear busin ess objectives, natu re of technology, infor mation classification and the 
resultant risk to the information resources. Further, suitable encry ption measures must be 
implemente d for protection of data being sent over third party ne tworks and comm unication  
backbone. To achieve t his, CIFCL  must adopt b est standards for encryption a nd effective key 
management practices.  
 
8.2. Computer Security  
8.2.1.  Anti-Virus  
Every host on the Company networ k wil l have anti -virus software installed . The anti -virus 
scanning eng ine and the virus definitions wi ll automatically be upd ated from one or more anti -
virus repository servers on the company network. The anti -virus managem ent server will be 
used to genera te on  demand reports on all host s in orde r to determine which hosts ar e not up to 
date.  
 
8.2.2.  DMZ Hosts  
A DMZ host is a computer which is accessible from outsi de the CIFCL  network by un -trusted 
parties. Even though firewalls ar e deployed they can still be defe ated by skilled attackers who 
would usual ly attempt to either disrupt the operation of a server hosted  in a demilitarized zon e 
(DMZ) or gain control of the  host for their own purposes. A DMZ is a network placed between 
the un-trusted Internet and the inter nal n etwork.  
Every host on the C ompany ne twork which is accessible fro m outside the Company network wi ll 
be in a DMZ network and at a minimum the perimeter  firewall to be configured with access list 
to restrict access to le gitimate traffic on the permitted  port s, prevent any remote appli cation 
from taking control of or using  excessive system resource.

10.1.  Secu ring Physical Systems  
Servers, SAN equipment, backup systems and key  network and security equipment w ill all be 
housed in a secure  environment  with adequate environmental control systems to ensure that 
the temperature remains constant and within acceptable  limits. In this environment there will 
also be effective fire suppr essant systems which will not dam age equipment in this environ ment 
if acti vated. This environment will have access control systems to p revent unauthorized ent ry as 
well as intrusion detect ion systems No smoking, eating or drinking will be allowed in this a rea. 
All local area network (LAN)  and other infrastructure equ ipment house d outside the main 
environmen t will also be housed in secure and lockable cabinets o r rooms. This will also apply 
to all cabling patch panels.  
 
10.2.  Restricting Physical Access  
Access to the communication rooms will be r estricted to authorized staff  members or 
authorized contractors. There  will be an entry log which must  be used by all staff a nd 
contractors that access the  secured environment. Access will only be granted to those who 
actua lly require it in order to perfor m a specific duty or duties.  
The need for  individual access will perio dically be reviewed in order to establish if that acces s is 
still required. Records n eed to be kept of who has been granted access to the secure 
environm ent. 
It is desirable to use an ac cess control system where acc ess is provi ded to devices such as 
electr onic keys, fobs or cards which a re in turn allocated to  staff members and contractors . 
Access levels and duration of access can be assigned to cards and removed as and when 
required. Acc ess should be removed for con tractors and  staff as soon as it is no lo nger required. 
When staff member s leave the Company per man ently they should return th eir access devices 
and this should be recorded. Contractors/Vendors should return their access cards every day 
when leaving the Co mpany.  
 
10.3.  Powe r 
All key systems will be con nected to UPS or other backup po wer such as backup gene rators so 
that in the event of  a power failure there will be enough time to perform a controlled s hutdown 
of Pc’s,  N etwork and ser ver equipment and where possi ble keep key  equipments powered on 
for an  extended period of time.  Howeve r heavy duty printers a nd scanners shall be exempted 
from this policy as the power consumption of such equipments is high  and it should be 
equipped with a  stabilizer.  
10.4.  Alerting

Business Critical Data should n ot be stored on local PC hard drives. This will make recovery 
very difficult in the event of a hard d rive failure. Instead data s hould be stor ed on shared server 
drives wh ere the server hardware provide s adequate resilience ag ainst the failure of a single 
server drive or component. IT services are not responsible for any data held on a local hard 
drive of  the users PCs or Laptops  
The Company wil l have a n approved back -up pr ocedure. The backup data will b e used for 
recovery in t he event of a system failure . Backup media will be clearly labeled and ideally stored 
in a fire -resistant safe which itself should be kept in a secure area.  Cholamandalam Investment  & Fin ance

 Page 19 of 31  Backup data wi ll be tested at regular inter vals to ensure that backups are  being done correctly 
and that data restoration is pos sible back to a given point in time. Once a test restore has been 
done the results will be compared w ith the original data. When a data restor e or recovery is 
required car e needs to be taken that the re store will not overwrite  or corrupt good data. If 
poss ible do the restore to an isolated test system first.  
 
13.2.  Off-site Sto rage and Archiving  
Data which need s to be archived for legal r eason and aud it purposes will be identifie d and this 
data will be the inc luded in the backup. Thi s data will then be held at an  off-site secure location.

significance of the risk posed by the same;  
• the potential impact of the outsourcing on the Company on various financial and risk 
parameters;  
• the li kely impact on the Company’s reputation and brand value, and a bility to achieve 
its business obj ectives, strategy and plans, should the service provider fail to perform 
the ser vice;  
• the cost of the outsourcing as a proportion of total operating costs of t he Company.

Internal IT Disaster Recovery Plan  
 
P r i v a t e  &  C o n f i d e n t i a l   P a g e  4 | Of13 
  
1. Introduction  
 
This plan is designed to guide CIFCL thr ough a recovery effort of identified IT Application Services. At the 
onset of an emergency condi tion, CIFCL employees and resources will r espond quickly to any condition, 
which could imp act CIFCL’s ability to run its critical Application Services. The proc edures contained within 
have been designed to provide clear, concise and essential directions to  recover from varying degrees of IT 
Applic ation Service interruptions and disasters.  
 
The Disaster Recovery Plan preparation process includes several major step s such as:  
• Analyze Business Impact on system non availability and determination of critical reco very metrics.  
• Invocation /  Declaration of  DR 
• Recovery team Organization & Responsibilitie s 
• Develop Recovery Strategy & Procedures  
• Emergency Vendor Contacts  
• Document Maintenance & Testing Procedures  
 
 
1.1. Objective  
 
The key objective of this plan is to detail the key activities required to reinstate a pplications 
within the agreed recovery objective s. Most effectively ‘Declaration of a Disaster’. Once an 
incident has been deemed serious enough that ‘forward fixing’ at the primary location is 
impractical or is li kely to result in an outage expending beyo nd the Maximum Tolerable Outage.  
 
This document lists the comprehensive set of instructions designed to recover the in frastructure, 
software and data necessary to support the CIFCL IT Application Services in a Disa ster Recovery 
environment. This document a lso includes appropriate level of details necess ary to recover the 
environment, the recovery methodology, and recovery  time.  
 
 
1.2. Scope  
 
The Scope includes the IT Application Services supporting the following Business  units of CIFCL:  
• Vehicle Finance  
• Home Equi ty 
• Personal Loans  
• Operations  
• Finance  
• Treasury  
• HR  
• Corporate & Mortgage Finance

• Credence  - CASTREA  
• Oracle Financials  
• QTRAC  
• HE – Encore (Origination, LMS and  Collect ions)  
 
 
1.4. Key Plan Assumptions  
  
The followi ng are the assumptions based on which the DR pla n is developed  
 
• Logistics & approvals for incident expenses at the tim e of d isaster is available  
• All communications will be routed via IT Helpdesk  
• Online data push f or subsystem integration with GL will not happen. It shall be uploaded 
manually to the GL System.  
• Switchover to Primary Site will happen once the Primary site is  resto red with all the required 
Services.  
 
The following activities are not in scope  of the IT Disaster recovery plan, However they may b e 
part of Overall BCP.  
 
• Personnel management and  public relations management – How and under what 
circumstances the org anizat ion will communicate with the employees and their relatives, 
media etc.  
• Staff is aware of  roles and responsibility for response in the event of a disaster.  
• Identification of alter nate location and relocating the personnel.  
• The infrastructure availabi lity f or employees to work from an alternate site identified  
Example Desk, Computers etc  
• Contin ued Power supply.  
• Blackberry Services  
• Ema ils that are lying on Production Servers would n ot be available.  
• Broadband Locations would not have access to IT Appli cation  services.  
 
 
 
1.5. Confidentiality Statement  
 
This Disaster Recovery Plan is classified as the  confidential property of CIFCL. Due to th e sensitive 
nature of the information contained herein, this manual is available only to those persons who 
have been de signat ed as plan participants, assigned membership to one of the CIFCL recovery 
teams, or who o therwise play a direct role in the recover y process. This manual remains the 
property of C IFCL and may be repossessed at any time. Unauthorized use or duplicatio n of t his

 2. Business Impact Analysis  
 
2.1. Objec tive 
 
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is the firs t step of implementing an IT Disaster Recovery Plan for an 
organization.  
 
BIA is performed to identify the key business applications and technology components that wo uld suffer 
the maximum financial, operatio nal, customer, and/or legal and regulatory loss in the event of a disaster.   
 
The main intent of a BIA is to identify a ll the  Critical IT Application Services that are required for the 
continuity of the business. Additionally, the time taken for recovery of such IT Applications Services will be 
identif ied.  
 
The Objectives of a BIA are as follows:  
 
• Estimate the financial i mpacts  for each business unit, assuming a worst -case scenario.  
• Estimate the intangible (Operat ional) impacts for each major business uni t. 
• Identify the applications supporting the or ganization’s business processes and the estimated 
recovery timeframe for e ach ma jor business unit.  
 
 
2.2. Assumptions to BIA  
 
The BIA exercise does not address recovery assu mptions, such as the availability of exper ienced personnel 
for recovery, new threats, or e merging trends in disaster recovery or business continuity are outside t he 
scope of the BIA.  
The recovery in case of a disaster for the purpose of this document is re stricted to IT Application Services.  
 
 
2.3. Pre-requisite for the BIA  Questionnaire  
 
For the pu rpose of this BIA, answers to each question should be based on the "wors t-case  scenario".  This 
means your workplace, all records, files and equipment in it are inacc essible.   
 
The objective of this question naire is to make out any business process or app lication that at present 
contains vital data. However, please answer all  quest ions regardless of data status.  By completing all 
questions to the best of your knowled ge, a recovery strategy that best meets th e need of the business can 
be established.  
 
 
The “overall weight” parameter decides the criticality of an application. The application with lowest 
Overall Weight is considered to b e a most critical application.  
Applications with least Overall Weight w ould  be restored first in the event a disaster affec ting more than 
one application s.

4. Team Charters  
 
The following presents the DR plan participants and their associated recovery function.  At the time of a 
disaster, these individuals will be among the first to b e contacted.  
 
Crisis Management Te am - The CMT is comprised of senior ma nage ment and is responsible for 
authorizing declarat ions of disaster, emergency investment strategy, approving public release of 
information, and ensuring donors and constituents are i nformed.  
 
Emergency Response Team  - The ERT is first on scene to assess  the damage caused by the disaster or 
ensure precaut ionary measures are taken in light of any impending disaster (e.g. inclement weather, etc.)  
Once the ERT determines the extent of t he disaster, they will either orde r an evacuation of the facility or 
work with facilities to mitigate the effects to organiz ation.  
The members of this team will also ensure that the alternate site is ready, and adequate for arriving 
recovery personnel.  
 
Recovery Site Team  - RST will be the  first at a meeting point or remote si te in order to carryout recovery 
operations. The RST  provides Support for IT Application and technology related issues. The members of 
this team will ensure the infrastructure & Applic ation Setup at the alternate site for the continual business 
operations.   Cholamandalam Investment and  Finance

P r i v a t e  &  C o n f i d e n t i a l   P a g e  8 | Of13 
  
Business Restoration Team  – The BRT consist of pe rsonnel from each Business units deemed critical to the 
continuation of organization and its supporting team like Operations & Finan ce. The captains of the BRT 
will g et an updated status from the ERT and RST to pass on to their team members to ensure promp t 
recovery of each departments processes.  
 
 
5. Recovery Strategy  
 
In order to facilitate a recovery regardless of the type or duration of disaster, multiple recovery str ategies 
have been identified.   
These strategies are categorized into three (3) levels.  E ach level is designed to provide an effective 
recovery solution equally matched to the duration of the emergency condition.  
 
LEVEL 1 : SHORT -TERM OUTAGE (RIDE -OUT) – INTRA DAY  
 
Single System Failure - Minimal damage event:  
A short -term outage is defined as  the period of time Organization can sustain without IT Application 
Services, or where an outage window of the same day or less woul d not allow adequate time to resto re / 
utilize automated recovery operat ions at Remote Site.  
 
During an outage of this kind steps would be taken to bring up the IT Application services as soon as 
possible and within acceptable MTO by using Intra Day proced ures such as re -installation of th e effected 
application on to a differe nt server, Backup & restoration from Onsite/Offsite/ Remote Site  Tape medias. 
Hence this outage is named as INTRA DAY outage and the procedures as INTRA DAY PROCEDURES.  
 
LEVEL 2: MEDIU M-TERM OUTAGE (TEMPORARY) – UPTO 4  WEEKS  
 
Single critical failure or mu ltiple noncritical failures:  
A medium -term outage is  defined as the period of time that Organization will execute its formal disaster 
recovery strategy, which includes actually declari ng a disaster. In this scenario, a n immediate threat to 
business operati ons has occurred, but the data center is still up an d running.  
A disaster may either be declared Companywide or only for the effected Application. The decision to 
declare a disaster wi ll be based on the amount of time / expense that is required to implemen t the formal 
recovery and the anticipated impact to the organization over this period of time.  
Even after all reasonable efforts using Intra Day Procedures if the incident did not get resolved, will have 
to execute a f ormal disaster recovery process for th e af fected Application/Service. If multiple 
Applicat ion/Services are affected due to this outage then the recovery procedures will be performed for 
the applications with lower Overall Weight as mentioned in BIA.  
 
LEVEL  3: LONG -TERM OUTAGE (RELOCATION) – 4 WEEK S OR MORE  
 
Imminent or actual data center failur e or a larger failure:  
A long -term outage is defined, as the period of time that the company will exceed the allowed occupancy 
time of its onsite recovery strategy. D uring this phase CIFCL will initiate a  physical move of personnel and 
resources and announ ce an organization wide disaster. Power failures, espionage, terrorism, and natural 
disasters fall into this category.

Internal IT Disaster Recovery Plan  
 
P r i v a t e  &  C o n f i d e n t i a l   P a g e  9 | Of13 
 The infrastr ucture at Remote Site has been des igned to Support approximately 15% of current production 
load. So Users will be identified  as per the above proposition during any Level -2 & Level -3 incidents that 
exceeds accepted MTO. CIFCL would follow the recovery proc edures as mentioned in the Emergen cy 
Restoration Procedures for the affe cted  application in restoring the services at Remote  Site.  
 
 
6. Recovery Metrics & Invocation  
 
Below are the two key recovery objectives which measures overall continuity of a system / se rvice due to 
a catastrophe.  
 
Recov ery Time Objectives  – how long will it  take for the IT Application Service to come up in D isaster 
Recovery Site once the decision to invoke a Disaster is taken.  
 
Recovery Point Objective  – from what time in the processing cycle is IT going to recover the d ata (how 
much data is business prepare d to lose or have to re -enter from an alternate sour ce).  
 
Maximum Tolerable Outage  - The maximum time that the business will survive from the initial service 
interruption.  
 
The recov ery objectives must be based upon business requirements identified by th e bu siness impact 
analysis (BIA) process.  
 
 
 
 
Above  diagram demonstrates the correlation between the incident starting, reporting process, 
investigation process, decision making proce ss and the recovery process.  
If th e MTO is Two days and the IT Disaster Reco very process takes Eight hours to perform from t he 
invocation point then the decision to invoke has to be made within Forty hours of the initial incident. 
Knowing this ‘lead time’ is crucial in implementing an effe ctive incident management and escalati on 
process. Thus the recovery of services will be wi thin the required recovery time” assuming we start the 
recovery immediately the incident is detected.

 6.1. DR Invocation  
 
CIFCL’s  decision process for implementing any  of the 3 Levels of Recovery Strateg ies to  support the 
restoration of critical organizat ion functions are based on the following declaration initiatives:  
 
• Every reasonable effort has been made to provide  the critical ser vices by first attempting to 
restore  the primary facility using intra -day proc edures.  
• After all reasonable efforts have fail ed to restore the primary facility, and usage of manual 
procedures severely degrades user support, CIFCL would invoke a recovery str ategy that requires 
the relocation o f personnel and resources to an alte rnate recovery facility.  
• If the outage will clearly extend past the acceptable period of time as mentioned in BIA, a 
declaration of disaster will immediately be made.  
 
Following are th e sequence of steps that would be fo llowed during a disaster:  
Steps:  Instructi ons: 
Incident Assessment  Once the Incident oc curs the incident investigation and impact assessment will be 
carried out by ERT & RST teams.  
Impact assessment would be carried ou t by RST teams for Level – 1 & Level -2 
Incidents, for Level -3 Incidents impact  assessment would be carried out by RST & 
ERT teams together and submit the details to DR recovery team leads.  
Select disaster level  Based on the Estimated Duration of the Outa ge, The level of incident would be 
decided as either a Level - 1 (INTRA DAY), Level-2 (TEMPORARY), or Level -3 
(RELOCATION) by the RST & ERT team leads.  
Decision to Invoke 
Disaster  In case of  Level -1 Incident: RST head (IT -Head) would send a formal 
comm unication to CMT & BST, subsequently  a detailed communication would be 
sent fr om Netaccess Helpdesk to all branches & locati ons. 
Level -2 & Level -3 Incidents: CMT call for an emergency meeting and if required 
announce a DR for the affected Application Servi ce / Services, Provide approvals for  
Incident and recovery related expen ses. 
Incident Approvals  High level incident relate d expenses would be approved by CMT/MD or Person 
designated.  
Notification  With the available media of communication (Notification m ails / telephone) a 
detailed communi cation would be sent which includes helpde sk contact numbers & 
Escalation Matrix and the  details of affected Application service / services and 
access details to all branches & locations.  
Activate alternate 
facilities.  Contact alternate facilities identi fied. Confirm the availability and a lert t hem of 
estimated arrival time.  
RST establish  
Command Center.  RST personnel are the first to arrive at the DR site to setup and organize the 
command center prior to the arrival of the CMT and support personnel.   
The following representatives are re quired  at the Command Center :  
• Crisis Management Tea m  
• Emergency Response Team  
• Business Restoration Team  
• Recovery Site Team  
Establish situation 
desk.  At the command center, establis h a dedicated line with operator to field all 
incoming calls.  Announce comman d center phone number to all recovery Cholamandalam Investment and  Finance

 Steps:  Instructi ons: 
particip ants. 
Failover and Recovery 
Steps  This would  be detailed  in the DR plan of the respective application  
Decision to call -off DR 
and Continuation of 
Services from Onsi te  Based on the feedback from all E RT, BR T, and RST Leads on the restoration of 
service s at Onsite, CMT would call -off DR and confirms the Continuation of services 
from Onsite.  
Notification  A detailed communication whi ch includes helpdesk contact numbers  & escalation 
matrix and details of restor ed application service and access details woul d be sent 
to all branches and locations.  
DR Sync  Based on the confirmation from all the recovery teams on system stability the DR 
sync for the affected Application / Service would be re -established.  
Closure  ERT & RST team leads would send a communicatio n to all Recovery team leads on 
the Closure of Disaster  
 
 
 
7. Document Maintenance & Testing  
 
7.1. Plan Maintenance  
 
To be effective, the  plan must be maintained in a prepare d state that accurately reflect s the curre nt IT 
environment, policies and procedures.    
 
Each application owne r should  maintain a DR plan for t he respective applicatio n and collaboratively  work 
with infrastructure team to execute the DR test and  DR activit y including recovery st eps. 
 
The plan shou ld be maintained at various locations and part ial or complete copies provided to all 
appropriate team personnel. Because confidential and sensitive information may be contained in the plan, 
all the team members sho uld be instructed to house copi es of the p lan in a secure manner.  
 
 
7.2. Plan Testing  
 
Testin g assists in identifying and addressing deficiencies. Testing also helps evaluate the ability of recovery 
teams to implement the pl an quickly and efficiently and check whether the required Recovery M etrics are 
met as per the BIA document.  
 
The following c omponents will be addressed during the IT Disaster Recovery plan test:  
 1. Co -ordination among recovery teams  
 2. Notification proc edures  
 3. Ability of recovery team t o implement the plan quickly an d efficient ly  
 4. Measure the Recovery Metrics

Internal IT Disaster Recovery Plan  
 
P r i v a t e  &  C o n f i d e n t i a l   P a g e  12 | Of13 
 The pur pose of testing is to demonstrate to both management and recovery teams the ability of one or 
more vital business processes to cont inue functioning inside the identifie d timeframe post an IT 
Applicat ion Service  interruption event.  
This exercise is not a pa ss/fail work effort but an opportunity to identify vulnerabilities and gaps in 
recovery plan.  
 
CIFCL will take up Functional Exerci se as its testing Mechanism for the D isaster Recovery Plan, The goal  
here is to  test or evaluate the efficiency of the DR pla n in recovering on ore more Applications in the 
context of an actual disaster. The focus will also be on training and familiarizati on with roles, recovery 
procedures an d responsibilities.  
 
• DR drill w ill  involv e  testing databases of all applications. DR d rill calender will be Q4 of every 
year .  
• DR Drill results would be published and shared with the management within two weeks of the  DR 
Drill.  
 
 
8. Emergency Contact Inform ation  
 
This section contains k ey personnel  from Disaster Recovery teams and their contac t information. The 
teams include  
• Crisis Management teams  
• Business restoration teams  
• Emergency response teams  
• Recovery Site teams  
• IT Helpdesk & Support team  
• Supplier & Vendors  
 
 
 
9. Review  
 
It is essential that t he plan be reviewed and updated regularly. The  plan should be  reviewed for 
accuracy and  
 
Completeness at leas t annually or whenever significant changes occur to any part of the plan.

Guidelines:   
- Each office or administrative unit of the Company should have a Committee.   
- Atleast 50% of the Committee should be women.   
- The term of the Committee should not be longer than 3 years.   
- Each Committee should  comprise of the following:   
i. A chairperson / presiding officer who shall be a senior level woman employee.   
The seniority required is not specified in the Act/Rules. Therefore, the Company can make 
an appropriate determination as to the appropriate seniority level of this woman employee. 
We would however recommend that you apply the rule on seniority of this member 
consistently across all units/offices.  
To illustrate: as a Company you may choose to decide that the chairperson should be 
atleast of vic e-president rank. It would then be advisable to ensure that the chairpersons of 
all committees across the Company are of atleast this rank. If a concerned unit has a 
woman of this chosen rank, she should be the chairperson of the Committee for that unit. I f 
there is no woman employee of that rank in the said unit, you can nominate a woman of 
that rank from another unit of the same company as chairperson.   
ii. Minimum of two members from amongst employees as members.   
Two is the minimum required – there is not p rohibition on more people being nominated as 
members (subject to atleast 50% of the total Committee being women).   
These members should preferably be persons committed to the cause of woman or 
persons who have some social work experience or have legal know ledge.   
iii. One external Member   
To be from (i) an NGO or associations committed to cause of women or (ii) a person who

Prepared by – HR,  Circulated on 5th March 2011  
Framed from the Group HR – Employee Separation policy  
 
 
 
Employee Separation Guidelines  
Broadly speaking, in normal scenarios the separation between employer and employee can be due to 
any of the following three:  
1) Resignation – Employee decides to leave the organization.  
2) Termination – Employer decides to break  the contract of employment.  
3) Absconding – When the employee decides to leave the organization without tendering his 
resignation or following the proper process of separation.  
Types of Separation  
1) Resignation - This is the most common way of separation. Emp loyee leaves his job and 
employment with his employer to pursue better opportunities; a better position at a better 
compensation package in a branded company (or better known company) in a same city and 
country or in a different city or different country.  Other reasons can be on Personal Grounds – 
To relocate to a different location due to family situations, Further Studies, Marriage.  
2) Company Initiated Separation / Termination - In Company Initiated Separation  / termination, 
an employer uses his right to t erminate the contract of an employment. There can be many 
reasons for an employer to terminate the contract of employment but some of the common 
reasons are:  
a. Non -Performance b) Indiscipline c) Misconduct d) Insubordination e) Theft and etc  
3) Absconding - This is one of the most unethical, unexpected and unprofessional way to terminate 
the contract of an employment. In this, on one fine day an employee decides not to go to work.  Employee Separation Guidelines  
Prepared by – HR,  Circulated on 5th March 2011  
Framed from the Group HR – Employee Separation policy  
 
Employees and supervisors must ensure the following actions occur within the pre scribed timelines of 
an employee's separation:  
Resignation:  
1. The employee submits intent to resign to the immediate supervisor.  
a) The intent to resign needs to be submitted either by email (in case the employee has an 
official email id in his name) or all other cases, in written format. If the notice is 
received by Human Resources, th e supervisor will be immediately notified.  If the 
notice is received by the supervisor, then he/she should immediately notify Human 
Resources.  
2. Generally, the employee should give his/her notice in writing stating the last day he/she will 
actually work and  the reasons for his/her resignation. The original letter/email should be sent to 
supervisor and a copy provided to HR, by the  employee . 
3. The immediate supervisor receives the intent submitted by the employee.  
a) The immediate supervisor requires to understan d the reasons for resignation.  
b) In case of a regretted resignation, the supervisor needs to look at avenues for retaining 
the employee.  
c) In case of non regretted resignation, accept the resignation and inform the possible date 
for relieving after fulfilling  the notice period.  
d) In both the cases (b or c), HR should be kept informed of the receipt of the resignation . 
4. The Acceptance of Resignation is intimated to HR along with the letter or email, stating the date 
of relieving a nd requirement for replacement within 24 hrs of the receipt from the employee.  
a) The Resignation acceptance is forwarded by mail or post to HR.  
b) The date of relieving needs to be mentioned in the email/hardcopy along with the 
reason for the resignation i.e. Better Opportunity / Personal Grounds / Further Studies / 
Marriage etc…  
c) The requi rement for replacement, if required, needs to be forwarded to HR.  
5. HR makes effort to retain the employee by dialoguing with the employee and understanding the 
reason. HR explores avenues to retain the employee.  Employee Separation Guidelines  
Prepared by – HR,  Circulated on 5th March 2011  
Framed from the Group HR – Employee Separation policy  
 
6. A confirmed resignation may be withdrawn at  the sole discretion and written approval of the 
supervisor and the Human Resources.  
7. Employees must notify their supervisors if they are going to be absent for any reason. If an 
employee is absent without prior supervisor approval, he or she must notify hi s or her 
supervisor of the reason for the absence at the earliest possible time.  
a)  If the employee has not provided such notification before the end of the working day , 
the supervisor must intimate to regional HR  with a copy to the HR – HO Operations .  
b) In such cases, HR will cons ider that the employee has voluntarily quit without notice, 
after submitting the resignation. Employees will be issued a show cause notice for being 
absent without notice or approval and if there is no response from the resigned 
employee  after two intimations , then termination communication will be issued, in -
spite employee submitting resignation initially.  
8. The serving of notice period is mandatory for all employees who wish to exit from the 
employment with the company. However in case of requirement of early relieving, the 
appr oval authority would be the Head – HR only, based to recommendation received from 
business / functional head.  
a) In case of relieving early (employee not attending office for any reason / joining new 
employer, after submission of resignation ), without intim ation or approval of HR, then 
the employment will be terminated as mentioned in point 7 (b) above.  
b) The immediate supervisor or the department head will not be authorized to waive the 
notice period, at any point in time.  
9. The available balance of Privilege l eave would be adjusted against the unserved notice period 
(subject to approval by Business head and HR)  
10. The final settlement would be done along with the normal payroll only.  
Company Initiated Separation / Termination  
1) (a) In case of non -performance, compa ny can initiate the separation, by taking resignation 
from the employee. For this, the requ ired documents must include:  
a. Tasks given  
b. Expected performance level  Employee Separation Guidelines  
Prepared by – HR,  Circulated on 5th March 2011  
Framed from the Group HR – Employee Separation policy  
 
c. Evaluation criteria  
d. Actual performance  
e. Shortfall  
f. Action required  
(b) If the employee is giv en sufficient time to perform (PIP - three months), and then the resignation is 
sought from the employee, then relieving can be immediate and payment of notice pay, either side, will 
not arise.  
(C) In other words, if resignation is sought from the employe e in lieu of non performance and immediate 
relieving is recommended by the superior, then notice pay (3 months basic) has to be paid to employee 
in the settlement.  
In both situations, Privilege Leave credit available will be en -cashed in the settlement wor kings.  
2) Termination can be challenged in the court of law. Hence, care must be taken to document all the 
incidents that have led to the termination of an employee.  
In case of disciplinary action, based on Indiscipline, Misconduct, Insubordination, Theft and etc., the 
company should take care that the proper procedure is followed.  
a) Warnings (oral and written) were issued to the employee and the whole incident is 
properly documented.  
b) Employee should be given the letter of termination clearly specifying the reasons of 
termination. Based on the severity of the case, the company might decide to pay the 
employee for the notice perio d.  The entire amount due from him must be recovered, 
before the settlement is given, after issue of the termination letter.  
In all the above cases of separation, Resignation, Company Initiated, Termination, before the contract of 
employment ends, the company should collect all the belongings, such as Computer / Laptop & 
Accessories, Data Chord, Documents, ID Card, Access Card, Medical  Insurance Card etc..  
 Employee Separation Guidelines  
Prepared by – HR,  Circulated on 5th March 2011  
Framed from the Group HR – Employee Separation policy  
 
Absconding Employee  
This is one of the most complicated ways of separation.  
1) If the employee did not come to the office and nor did he informed about his whereabouts, 
please send an e mail communication to HR immediately, and try to co ntact him on his mobile 
phone.  
2) If he /she  is not answering calls or mobile phone is not working then try to call him /her  on 
his/her  residence number. Even if that is not working then speak to his /her  friends in the office 
to assess the situation.  
3) In case you are no t able to get any information about the employee then assume that he has 
absconded and inform Regional HR/HR Operations – HO. 
4) In such cases also, a letter of warning and need to report at work is sent to the employee by HR.  
5) On non receipt of confirmation,  a letter of termination is issued to the employee. If the 
employee reports on his whereabouts, a letter of warning is issued.  
For all types of separations listed above, Regional HR and HR Operations at Head Office should be 
included in the communication a nd updates to be given regularly.

What is “Bring your Buddy” Program?  
It is the Organisation’s employee referral program  that provides an opportunity for all full -time 
employees of Chola to receive a cash reward for recommending friends to apply for the open 
positions in Chola.  
Who can participate?  
All full -time employees can participate in the referral program.  
How should I refer a candid ate?  
The recruitment team will share the open positions with all employees,  if you know a friend who is 
likely to fit one of the jobs posted, you can refer hi m/her by sending an email to 
friends@chola .murugappa.com   with the CV and contact details of the candidate mentioning the 
Department and Location for which the candidate is referred.  
What is the inc entive for participating in the referral program?  
The Incentive structure is as follows:  
 
When will the referrer be awarded?  
The referrer will receive their referral incentive after the referred applicant is hired and 
successfully completes 3 months in the company.    (Needless to add, you must still be on the rolls of 
the company when the referred employee completes 3 months!)  
Is there a limit on how many referrals an employee can make?  
There is no limit to how many applicants an employee can refer.  
If I refer a person for a position that directly or indirectly reports to me, will I be eligible for 
the Incentive under the scheme?  
No. A Manager who refers a candidate for a position in his department i.e. with a direct or skipped 
reporting relationship is not eligible for the incentive.  
e.g.: To explain with an example, a Re gional Manager is not eligible for the incentive if he refers a 
candidate for any position in any of the branches reporting to him.    However, he is eligible  for 
incentive  if he refers candidates for positions in any other Region.  
Are there any other restr ictions which will make me ineligible for an incentive under the 
scheme?  
Only a few!  
You will not be eligible for the incentive for referring the following types of candidates:  
• If the candidate already works in the company or has worked here within the l ast twelve months.  
• If the candidate is an employee of CBSL  
Also, the following types of employees are not eligible for the incentive under the scheme:  
• Managers in grades MG 7 and above  
• All employees of HR Department  
What happens if the candidate ha s already applied to the company before I refer  him/ her or 
if he/she is referred from more than one source - for example, from two employees, or an 
employee and an employment agency?  
In such cases, the deciding factor will be the date of receipt of the re ferral in the Human Resources 
department. The HR department will inform the participating parties when such situations arise.

Number of Awards:  
As C hola receives several requests for dif ferent organizations, in order to prioritize over between the invites it 
receives, it is proposed that the number of applications are restricted to a maximum of 5 application in category A 
and C respectively per financial year. No restriction on number of applications shall be applied to awards in 
Category B.  The number or sectorial awards that can be applied for by any function or business would also be 
restricted to 3 per department.  
Data  Sharing:  
Many award applications seek information in the form of a filled in questionnaire, other additional data to be 
submitted etc. It is proposed to discourage sharing of any data about Chola’s business numbers or operations that 
is not already present in the p ublic domain. Sharing of any information that is not available in the public domain 
for the purposes of application of awards would require an express approval from the Managing Director.  
Receiving of awards :  
It is generally the practice of the entities o rganizing the awards to communicate informally prior to the awards 
event if the applicant has won any award. In the event of Chola winning any awards, it is proposed that we 
enquire about the chief guest/panel that shall be handing out the awards. Based on  the information received 
from the organizers, Chola would decide on the appropriate persons to receive the award.  
As a norm, if the awards are  being handed over by a prominent member of society, an industry stalwart or a 
senior member of the government, t hen the award must be received by the Managing Director or executive 
director of the company. The Managing Director or Executive Director may choose to delegate this to 
function/departmental heads.  
In cases where the award is being received from a panel or  jury that is not a public figure, the head of 
departments may accept the award on behalf of the organization. It is not recommended that this be further 
delegated by the department head, however, exceptions can be made with the consent of the MD on a case  to 
case basis.
