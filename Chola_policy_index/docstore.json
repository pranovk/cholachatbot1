Purpose  \nThe purpose of this policy is to establish and define standards, procedures, and restrictions \nfor the di sposal of IT eq uipment in a leg al, cost -effective  manner. CIFCL o bsolete IT assets \nand resources (i.e. desktop computers, laptops, servers, etc.) must be discarded according \nto legal requirements and environmental regulations through the appropriat e extern al \nagents and C IFCL upgrade gui delines. Therefore , all disposal p rocedures for retired IT \nassets must adhere to company -approved methods.  \n \n2. Scope  \nThis policy applies to the proper disposal of all CIFCL IT hardware, including PCs, laptops, \ntabs, prin ters, se rvers, switches , and routers. C ompany -owned surpl us hardware, obs olete \nmachines, and any equipment beyond reasonable repair or reuse are covered by this \npolicy. Where assets have not reached end of life, it is desirable to achieve some residual \nvalue of th e IT asset in q uestion through donation, or reass ignment to a les s-critical \nfunction.  \n \n3.

It is, however, the goal of CFCL \nto \u2013 whenever possible \u2013 reassign  IT assets in order to achieve full ret urn on investment \n(ROI) from the e quipment and to minimize hardware expenditures when f easible \nreassig nment to another business function  will do instead.  \n \nTrade -Ins: Where applicable, cases in which a piece of equipm ent is due for replacement \nby a newer m odel, reasonable actions must be t aken to ensure that a fair and market trade -Cholamandalam Investme nt & Finance \nCom pany Limited  Policy Document  Asset  Disposal  Policy  \n     \nPrivate and Confidential  Page 6 of 6  in value is obtained for  the old IT asset against the cost  of the replacement. CIFCL Head of \nIT will assume this responsibility.  \n \nIncome D erived from Disposal:  Whenever possible , it is desirable to achieve some \nresidual value from retired or surplus IT assets. Any  and all receip ts from the sale of IT \nassets must  be kept and submitted to the appropriate department. Income derived from \nsales must be fully receipted and monies sent to CIFCL Finance department.

The IT department will inventory and stoc kpile these \nparts.

The roles and responsibilities of \nvarious members of the Management Information Security Committee with in CIFCL  are defined \nbelow.  \n2.0 Define Cyber Security  \nCyber secu rity or information technol ogy security are the techniques of protec ting computers, \nnetworks, programs and data from unauthorized access or attacks that are aimed for exploitation. \nCyber security is the body of the tech nolo gies, processes and practices des igned to protect networks, \ncomputers, programs and data from attack,  damage or unauthorized access and from any cyber risks.  \n3.0 What Are We Protecting  \nIt is the obligation of all users of the company systems to protect the  technology and information \nassets of  the company.  This informa tion must be protected from unauthorized access, theft and \ndestruction. The technology and information assets of the company are made up of the following \ncomponents:  \n\u25aa Computer hardware, CPU, di sc, Email, web sites, application ser vers, PC systems, applicati on \nsoftware, system software, etc. positi oned at multiple locations across geography and includes \nData Center (DC) and Disaster Recovery (DR).  \n \n\u25aa System Software including: operating systems, da taba se management systems, and backup  and \nrestore software, comm unications protocols, and so forth.  \n \n\u25aa Appl ication Software: used by the various departments within the company.

The level of security to be afforded to the data/information of CIFCL  should depend \ndirectly on the classification level of the dat a. All employees, who come in contact  with information \nproprieta ry to CIFCL  or its c ustomers , are expecte d to familiarize themselves with th is data \nclassification scheme.  \nAll Information assets of the company will be accounted for and will have a nominated  own er. All \ninformation must be class ified by the respective inf ormation asset owners into one of the fou r \nclassifications: Highly Confidential, Confidential, Restricted /Internal  or Public.  \nThe assets shall be labelled  and secured appropriately based on th e classification, from the time it is  \ncreated until the time it is destroyed . \nRefer Information Security Controls Policy v3. 4 \n5.0 Threats to Security  \n5.1 Amateur Hackers and Vandals  \nThese people are the most common type of attackers on the Internet.  The probabili ty of attack is \nextremely high and th ere is also likely to be a large number of attacks. These are usuall y crimes of \nopportunity.  Th ese amateur hackers scan the Internet and look for well -known security holes that \nhave not been plugged.  Web servers and e lectronic mail are their favourite  targets.  Once they find a \nweakness they will exploit it to plant viru ses, Trojan horses, or use the resources of your system for \ntheir own means.  If they do not find an obvious weakness they are likely to move on to an easier \ntarget  \n5.2 Personnel  \nOne of the bi ggest security threats coul d be Personnel.

The ski ll of these attackers is me dium to high as they are likely to \nbe tra ined in the use of the latest hacker tools. The attacks are well planned and are based on any \nweaknesses discovered that will allow a foothold into the  network.

Executive Summary  \n \nData continuity is divided into regular backup and restoratio n programs for any \ndisaster recovery and fault -tolerant systems for high availability. Copying of \ndata or  information can be achieved using various techniques  to provide the \nability to restore a critical application  \n \n1.1. Backup  \n \n\u2022 Scheme \u2013 Electronic data will b e copied from Disk to Tape for \nservers which are on SAN and for all other Small er files / File \nsystem  / Folders will be backed up to Disk  and then to a Second  \ntape.  The tapes may be created separately or simultaneously. One \ntape shall be kept onsite at the  live Datacenter  and will reside \ninside the tape library . The second tape shall go to an offsit e \nstorage location.  \n \n\u2022 Frequency \u2013 Service related electronic dat a will be copied once a \nday using one of the standard backup types (FULL, Incremental or \nDifferent ial) with a full backup scheduled on Sunday of the week. \nFull backups are required immediately prior to m ajor changes and  \n/ or upgrades to services  \n \n\u2022 Retention  \u2013 Daily backup tapes are recycled on a weekly basis, \nWeekly tapes are recycled every month, Month ly backup tapes are \nretained for 12 months and yearly tapes for 8 years  \n \n\u2022 Off-Site Storage \u2013 All backup ta pes designated as Offsite will be \nsent to the offsite  location.  \n \n\u2022 Scheduling \u2013 Execution of backups are carried out during non peak \nhours and with least  activity on the Systems/Service.  \n \n\u2022 Security \u2013 The backup data will be encrypted and copied to t he \nOnsite media, and then the media is labeled and stored in a secure \nplace.

Recovery Strategy  \n \nIn order to facilitate a recovery regardless of the type or duration of disaster, multiple recovery str ategies \nhave been identified.   \nThese strategies are categorized into three (3) levels.  E ach level is designed to provide an effective \nrecovery solution equally matched to the duration of the emergency condition.  \n \nLEVEL 1 : SHORT -TERM OUTAGE (RIDE -OUT) \u2013 INTRA DAY  \n \nSingle System Failure - Minimal damage event:  \nA short -term outage is defined as  the period of time Organization can sustain without IT Application \nServices, or where an outage window of the same day or less woul d not allow adequate time to resto re / \nutilize automated recovery operat ions at Remote Site.  \n \nDuring an outage of this kind steps would be taken to bring up the IT Application services as soon as \npossible and within acceptable MTO by using Intra Day proced ures such as re -installation of th e effected \napplication on to a differe nt server, Backup & restoration from Onsite/Offsite/ Remote Site  Tape medias. \nHence this outage is named as INTRA DAY outage and the procedures as INTRA DAY PROCEDURES.  \n \nLEVEL 2: MEDIU M-TERM OUTAGE (TEMPORARY) \u2013 UPTO 4  WEEKS  \n \nSingle critical failure or mu ltiple noncritical failures:  \nA medium -term outage is  defined as the period of time that Organization will execute its formal disaster \nrecovery strategy, which includes actually declari ng a disaster. In this scenario, a n immediate threat to \nbusiness operati ons has occurred, but the data center is still up an d running.  \nA disaster may either be declared Companywide or only for the effected Application. The decision to \ndeclare a disaster wi ll be based on the amount of time / expense that is required to implemen t the formal \nrecovery and the anticipated impact to the organization over this period of time.  \nEven after all reasonable efforts using Intra Day Procedures if the incident did not get resolved, will have \nto execute a f ormal disaster recovery process for th e af fected Application/Service. If multiple \nApplicat ion/Services are affected due to this outage then the recovery procedures will be performed for \nthe applications with lower Overall Weight as mentioned in BIA.  \n \nLEVEL  3: LONG -TERM OUTAGE (RELOCATION) \u2013 4 WEEK S OR MORE  \n \nImminent or actual data center failur e or a larger failure:  \nA long -term outage is defined, as the period of time that the company will exceed the allowed occupancy \ntime of its onsite recovery strategy. D uring this phase CIFCL will initiate a  physical move of personnel and \nresources and announ ce an organization wide disaster. Power failures, espionage, terrorism, and natural \ndisasters fall into this category.  \n Cholamandalam Investment and  Finance \nCompany Limited  Policy Document  \nInternal IT Disaster Recovery Plan  \n \nP r i v a t e  &  C o n f i d e n t i a l   P a g e  9 | Of13 \n The infrastr ucture at Remote Site has been des igned to Support approximately 15% of current production \nload.

Emp loyee leaves his job and \nemployment with his employer to pursue better opportunities; a better position at a better \ncompensation package in a branded company (or better known company) in a same city and \ncountry or in a different city or different country.  Other reasons can be on Personal Grounds \u2013 \nTo relocate to a different location due to family situations, Further Studies, Marriage.  \n2) Company Initiated Separation / Termination - In Company Initiated Separation  / termination, \nan employer uses his right to t erminate the contract of an employment. There can be many \nreasons for an employer to terminate the contract of employment but some of the common \nreasons are:  \na. Non -Performance b) Indiscipline c) Misconduct d) Insubordination e) Theft and etc  \n3) Absconding - This is one of the most unethical, unexpected and unprofessional way to terminate \nthe contract of an employment. In this, on one fine day an employee decides not to go to work.

If the \nnotice is received by the supervisor, then he/she should immediately notify Human \nResources.  \n2. Generally, the employee should give his/her notice in writing stating the last day he/she will \nactually work and  the reasons for his/her resignation. The original letter/email should be sent to \nsupervisor and a copy provided to HR, by the  employee . \n3. The immediate supervisor receives the intent submitted by the employee.  \na) The immediate supervisor requires to understan d the reasons for resignation.  \nb) In case of a regretted resignation, the supervisor needs to look at avenues for retaining \nthe employee.  \nc) In case of non regretted resignation, accept the resignation and inform the possible date \nfor relieving after fulfilling  the notice period.  \nd) In both the cases (b or c), HR should be kept informed of the receipt of the resignation . \n4.

Employees will be issued a show cause notice for being \nabsent without notice or approval and if there is no response from the resigned \nemployee  after two intimations , then termination communication will be issued, in -\nspite employee submitting resignation initially.  \n8. The serving of notice period is mandatory for all employees who wish to exit from the \nemployment with the company. However in case of requirement of early relieving, the \nappr oval authority would be the Head \u2013 HR only, based to recommendation received from \nbusiness / functional head.  \na) In case of relieving early (employee not attending office for any reason / joining new \nemployer, after submission of resignation ), without intim ation or approval of HR, then \nthe employment will be terminated as mentioned in point 7 (b) above.  \nb) The immediate supervisor or the department head will not be authorized to waive the \nnotice period, at any point in time.  \n9. The available balance of Privilege l eave would be adjusted against the unserved notice period \n(subject to approval by Business head and HR)  \n10. The final settlement would be done along with the normal payroll only.  \nCompany Initiated Separation / Termination  \n1) (a) In case of non -performance, compa ny can initiate the separation, by taking resignation \nfrom the employee. For this, the requ ired documents must include:  \na. Tasks given  \nb.

Evaluation criteria  \nd. Actual performance  \ne. Shortfall  \nf. Action required  \n(b) If the employee is giv en sufficient time to perform (PIP - three months), and then the resignation is \nsought from the employee, then relieving can be immediate and payment of notice pay, either side, will \nnot arise.  \n(C) In other words, if resignation is sought from the employe e in lieu of non performance and immediate \nrelieving is recommended by the superior, then notice pay (3 months basic) has to be paid to employee \nin the settlement.  \nIn both situations, Privilege Leave credit available will be en -cashed in the settlement wor kings.  \n2) Termination can be challenged in the court of law. Hence, care must be taken to document all the \nincidents that have led to the termination of an employee.  \nIn case of disciplinary action, based on Indiscipline, Misconduct, Insubordination, Theft and etc., the \ncompany should take care that the proper procedure is followed.  \na) Warnings (oral and written) were issued to the employee and the whole incident is \nproperly documented.  \nb) Employee should be given the letter", "start_char_idx": 349748, "end_char_idx": 353625, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9043ba9d-e10e-4c45-a8a4-f6d3f6d70923": {"__data__": {"id_": "9043ba9d-e10e-4c45-a8a4-f6d3f6d70923", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5b7c111-fda1-4171-a37c-a3d559653e03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a28398b2c87b4ebbc87f03ad9d9fd2b942848e9d030fb4f86a6bb86f074afb93"}, "2": {"node_id": "896e7eee-dca7-4c70-9f5b-9809ad4b82f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc0f85652e11aa646f49006b9d71f1b070620b37eb0b935df536e377f366cd7c"}, "3": {"node_id": "47ee45e5-e31c-4de5-9fbb-fae5317c11f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1fb00d35e49d95c8f912e2621237e9fa7b5fbc32f144d74b05cdeaedbf448532"}}, "hash": "397d93479f2b7868427beb7543a345ded0b5f0fa205e36f3aa73bfae487a0851", "text": "should be given the letter of termination clearly specifying the reasons of \ntermination.
